# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, 2018
### Language: Python

**Today's Progress:**
* Worked on `requests` and `Beautiful Soup`

**Thoughts:** Working with scraping is one of my favorites, because it can automate things I need from the web.


### Day 2: June 13, 2018
### Language: Python

**Today's Progress:**
* Worked on `requests` and `Beautiful Soup`
* Downloads the latest pictures from [devhumor](http://devhumor.com/)
* Imitated project `downloadXkcd.py` from [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart

**Thoughts:** Downloading the pictures from devhumor opened many ideas for web scraping


### Day 3: June 14, 2018
